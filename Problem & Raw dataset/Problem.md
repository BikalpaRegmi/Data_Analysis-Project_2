# Problem Statement for Project II

## Problem:
Road traffic accidents in Nepal are increasing every year, causing significant loss of life, injuries, and economic damage. Local authorities, transportation planners, and insurance companies struggle to identify high-risk areas and times, making it difficult to allocate resources efficiently or implement preventive measures.

## Objective of the Project:
- To analyze Nepal’s road traffic accident data (2023–2026) and provide actionable insights by:

- Identifying accident hotspots (districts, roads, or regions) and peak accident times.

- Highlighting patterns by vehicle type, accident severity, and other available factors.

- Forecasting future accident trends to help authorities and businesses plan interventions, improve traffic safety, and reduce losses.

## Impact / Value:

- **Government & Transport Authorities:** Can implement targeted safety campaigns and infrastructure improvements in high-risk areas.

- **Insurance Companies:** Can adjust risk policies and allocate claims resources better.

- **Public Awareness:** Drivers can be alerted about high-risk times or locations, potentially reducing accidents.
